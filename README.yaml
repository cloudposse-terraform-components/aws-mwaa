  This component provisions Amazon managed workflows for Apache Airflow.

  The s3 bucket `dag_bucket` stores DAGs to be executed by MWAA.

  ## Access Modes

  ### Public

  Allows the Airflow UI to be access over the public internet to users granted access by an IAM policy.

  ### Private

  Limits access to users within the VPC to users granted access by an IAM policy.

  - MWAA creates a VPC interface endpoint for the Airflow webserver and an interface endpoint for the pgsql metadatabase.
    - the endpoints are created in the AZs mapped to your private subnets
  - MWAA binds an IP address from your private subnet to the interface endpoint

  ### Managing access to VPC endpoings on MWAA

  MWAA creates a VPC endpoint in each of the private subnets.
